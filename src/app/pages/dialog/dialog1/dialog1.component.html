  <h3>Architecture overview</h3>

  <p>Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript.
    Angular is itself written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a
    set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.</p>

  <p>The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation
    context for components. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is
    defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a root module that enables
    bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.</p>

  <p>Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and
    modify according to your program logic and data. Every app has at least a root component.</p>

  <p>Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views.
    Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular,
    reusable, and efficient.</p>

  <p>Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark their type and
    provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.</p>

  <p>The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. A
    template combines ordinary HTML with Angular directives and binding markup that allow Angular
    to modify the HTML before rendering it for display.</p>

  <p>The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available
    to components through Dependency Injection (DI).</p>

  <p>An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides
    the Router service to help you define navigation paths among views. The router provides
    sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.</p>
